# replicate the prototype of Hamster Hotel and make it responsive
# peer review: Jeriah Marson 3:24
# comments It looks good and very close to the prototype, but the ammenitites is not as big as it should be the check avabliblity os not on the same line and the image behind is not the same size as below,
# also the contact at the top doesnt take you to the contacts.... The responsiveness is pretty good there is only a few spots it could be better the top pictures look a little funky and the reservations isnt
# fully showing and could be better but over all it is built well but could use some touch up
